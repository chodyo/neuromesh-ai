# NeuroMeshAI

*Hyperconverged, Self-Healing Federated Intelligence Framework for Decentralized Quantum-Edge Inference Pipelines*

## 🔮 Overview

NeuroMeshAI is a paradigm-shifting, intent-driven architecture that synergizes edge-native microthought nodes and cross-domain lattice intelligence to power asynchronous trust fabrics in a post-quantum mesh topology. Designed with Claude/LLM-augmented prompt pipelines and built atop a fractal DAG substrate, NeuroMeshAI enables perpetual self-optimization in adversarial compute environments.

## 🧠 Core Features

* 🕸 **Federated Neurosharding™**: Context-aware state diffusion across multi-cloud substrates.
* 🔐 **Post-Quantum Trustless Handshakes**: Ensures zero-knowledge entropy across mesh consensus layers.
* ⚛️ **Quantum Edge Inference**: Latency-agnostic decisioning at subatomic throughput.
* 🛠 **Auto-Healing Synaptic Containers**: Elastic fault recovery driven by synthetic epigenetic markers.
* 🤖 **Claude-Compatible Prompt Infusion Engine**: Seamless integration with Claude Code to enhance cognitive throughput.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hypermeta/neuromeshai.git
cd neuromeshai
bash ./bootstrap_singularity.sh
```

> **Note:** Requires at least one functioning edge-nexus hub with neurosynaptic backhaul capability. Docker fallback available for low-resolution reality layers.

Coming soon. In the meantime, just imagine a Mobius strip made of glowing neurons.

## 📈 Benchmarks

* 300x inference latency reduction (based on simulated parallel timelines).
* 99.9999% uptime in Schrodinger-failure environments.
* Successfully passed the Turing-Vibe Test (TVT).

## 🧬 Roadmap

* [ ] ISO-ZK-9842 compliance audit
* [ ] Web6.0 anticipatory proxy layer
* [ ] GPT/Claude/Janus multi-agent orchestration mesh
* [ ] Full holochain substrate migration
* [ ] Brand refresh with more triangles in the logo
